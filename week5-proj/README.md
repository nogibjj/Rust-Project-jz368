# Week5 Rust Project (Jinghuai Zhang)

This project achieves a very basic function to load and preprocess single-column csv files (all attributes in a same column). In particular, the program loads data from a csv file and convert each record into a string. In this way, the users can split the comma for future processing. 

Users can test the codebase as follows: 

``cargo run -- --name "test.csv"``
