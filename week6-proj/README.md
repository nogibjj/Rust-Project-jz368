# Week6 Rust Project (Jinghuai Zhang)

This project achieves a very basic image processing function: Calculate the histogram of an input image.

In particular, users need to edit the file_name and save_name at the beginning of the main.rs file. And then run the codebase as follows: 

``RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run``

For example:

Input:

<img width="642" src="lenna.png">

Output:

<img width="642" src="histogram.png">
