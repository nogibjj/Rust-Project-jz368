# Week4 Rust Project (Jinghuai Zhang)

This project achieves a very basic plotting function: drawing a line segment based on the slope and bias.

In particular, users need to enter the line information in the Args. And then run the codebase as follows: 

``cargo run``

The result is saved in result.png.
